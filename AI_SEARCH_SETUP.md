The Creator Search app now includes AI-powered natural language search using OpenRouter with GPT-4o-mini model. Users can search using phrases like "Turkish gaming creators with high engagement" instead of manually setting filters.

## Features

âœ… **Natural Language Processing**: Convert queries like "Turkish tech creators" into structured filters
âœ… **Smart Fallback**: Works even without OpenRouter API key using keyword matching
âœ… **Real-time Processing**: Instant translation of queries to database filters
âœ… **Cost Effective**: Uses OpenRouter for competitive AI model pricing
âœ… **User Friendly**: Provides example queries and shows last search

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Sign up/Login with your account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

### 2. Add Environment Variables

2. Add: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` = `sk-your-openrouter-key-here`
3. Set for Production, Preview, and Development environments

### 3. Without OpenRouter API Key

The system works without an API key using intelligent keyword matching:
- âœ… Platform detection: "Instagram creators" â†’ filters by Instagram
- âœ… Location detection: "Turkish creators" â†’ filters by Turkey  
- âœ… Vertical detection: "gaming influencers" â†’ filters by Gaming
- âœ… Engagement detection: "high engagement" â†’ filters by strong engagement

4. Returns structured filter object
5. Filters applied to search automatically

### Fallback System
